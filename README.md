# HEALTHMAXXING

HEALTHMAXXING is a web application designed for people taking medication pernamently or for a prolonged period of time.

## Main Features
(for now, all the features are on development or desing stage)

- **Medication reminders** ‚è∞
  - It's the core idea standing behind this project. We wanted to prepare a reminder app with our own twist on it.
- **Assistant application user** üë®‚Äçüëß
  - As the main target of such app are prenamently ill people, whose cognitive abilities may be negatively affected by their illnesses, we want to give the possibility for caretakers to help manage the app features.
- **Doctor - patient communication support** ü©∫
  - Our goal is to allow patients to seamlessly and directly share information with their leading doctor. This feature includes health documentation sharing, patient-doctor chat,  doctor-managed medication list and non-medical health recommendation from the doctor to improve patients well-being or recovery.
- **Partly editable list of taken medication with dose tracking** üíä
  - Why would you get a reminder app, if you couldn't set the reminder? This feature is for people adding their own medication and supplements to the list. Of course, all reminders of medication prescibed by doctor cannot be edited by the patient. If this ever ended up being a real product, we'd like to integrate medication adding feature with electronic prescription systems (such as e-Recepta).
- **Health parameters tracker** (e.g. heart rate, sugar level) ‚ù§
  - Other than tracking the medication record, we'd like to allow patients to track their health status with other parameters, also recommended by the doctor. Leading doctor can see added records, to monitor patient's status.
- **Virtual pet supporting you** üê∂
  - Even though health should be the main motivation for this application's usage, many people need an additional factor to keep their motivation high up. That's why we want to add a virtual pet, which is dependant on patient's "performance". Also, patients can purchase items to customize their pet with in-app currency earned by recording medication usage. To reduce the possibility of medication misusage, the currency is given daily only when all planned medication has been tracked that day. The amount of given currency is always consistent and independent of medication dose.
- **Biometric authentication** (Hopefully) üëÜ
  - As the feature says above. We'd like to make this app both secure and easy to use.

## About us
This project was born during 4th Cognitive Scientific Hackaton (organized by Adam Mickiewicz University in Pozna≈Ñ, Poland), where we managed to prepare the concept, simple prototype and find some research on gamification of such apps. We began this project in a group of four, but only two of us decided to continue working on HEALTHMAXXING.
